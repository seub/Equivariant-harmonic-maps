******************************** PILE ********************************

Change the code of the mesh constructor so there is no need to rearrange the order after for building the graph (yuck)
Rewrite triangulater with flips?
construct mesh and graphes in thread?
Edit doc.


******************************** IMPROVE CODE ********************************

assert vs throw
track down code duplication
move semantics http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/what-are-move-semantics
hunt memory leaks, test with valgrind
use auto
use C++ arrays instead of vectors in some places? Eg: std::vector< std::vector<Point> > getTrianglesUp() : could this be a std::vector<Point[3]> or something?


******************************** BUGS: ********************************

Program should handle when a nonconvex fundamental domain is given, at the moment it will just crash (or not) when constructing the mesh.
(still happening?)

More generally, get the exception handling ready to work (catch errors in MainApplication)


************************* FUTURE PLANS ***************************

0. Meet at least N days per year, where N>>1
1. Think about discretization of Energy. In particular:
- should we take into account energy accumulated at vertices (/edges)?
- what are better weights for the energy?
- etc


2. Think about equivariance: Explain the picture of the (almost) harmonic map from a rho to its Dehn twist.
3. Improve choice of steiner points and cuts
4. Improve choice of fundamental domain (try dirichlet?)
6. H3 and SL(2,C)-character variety
7. Paths in the character variety...
8. Hopf differential? Energy?
9. Do youtube video!
10. Improve triangulations by adding points to the cuts?
11. Attempt optimalStep with *different* steps at different mesh points.
12. Optimization using Newton's method to minimize Energy.
13. See section PAPER.
14. Implementation with flat structures in the domain (making triangulation easier)

************************* APPLICATIONS ***************************

Other people:
- Daniele Alessandrini's idea to test Goldman conjecture (about affine sphere or something)
- Show a path of harmonic maps when moving between components of the SL2R character variety.
- Jean-Marc's question about convexity (and the Weil-Petersson metric)

- Asymptotic behavior
- Mike Wolf shit
Us:
- Investigating Hitchin metric
- minimal surfaces parametrization, (globally minimizing energy) -- "evidence for Labourie's conjecture"


************************* OPTIMIZATION ***************************


Optimization of heat flow:
- use profiler
- try acceleration Ã  la circle packings (see tests.cpp)
- recursive depth
- Newton method


**************************** PAPER ********************************

1. Imagine possible statements of theorems
- requires a theoretical understanding of relationship of "discretized energy" to actual energy

2. Pseudocode description of main algorithms:
- FN coords --> represention
- representation --> triangulated fundamental domain
- implementation of mesh
- energy calculation and gradient flows
- centroid flow (and difference between Riemannian centers of mass and "hyperbolic centroid")

3. Mathematical background:
- Higher Teichmuller theory and non-abelian Hodge correspondence
- numerical methods and gradient flows
- harmonic maps and equivariance

4. Demonstration:
- screenshots from program
- Mike Wolf shit
- down-to-earth programming stuff (language, # of objects, operating systems)

5. Applications (see APPLICATIONS)
