******************************** PILE ********************************

Change the code of the mesh constructor so there is no need to rearrange the order after for building the graph (yuck)
Rewrite triangulater with flips?


construct mesh and graphes in thread?

Edit doc.


******************************** IMPROVE CODE ********************************

assert vs throw
track down code duplication
move semantics http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/what-are-move-semantics
hunt memory leaks, test with valgrind
use auto

use C++ arrays instead of vectors in some places? Eg: std::vector< std::vector<Point> > getTrianglesUp() : could this be a std::vector<Point[3]> or something?


******************************** BUGS: ********************************

Program should handle when a nonconvex fundamental domain is given, at the moment it will just crash (or not) when constructing the mesh.

More generally, get the exception handling ready to work (catch errors in MainApplication)


************************* FUTURE PLANS ***************************

0. Don't break keys off in locks.
1. Are quadratic weights dead? (YES)
2. Think about equivariance: Explain the picture of the (almost) harmonic map from a rho to its Dehn twist.
3. Improve choice of steiner points and cuts
4. Improve choice of fundamental domain (try dirichlet?)
5. Think about automating in a totally different way: Fix a weighted graph that triangulates the surface ahead of time (relations on weights?),
and use the algorithm to embed it "harmonically" on the surface.
6. H3 and SL(2,C)-character variety?
7. Slices of the character variety and pictures?
8. Hopf differential? Energy?

9. Do youtube video!
10. Improve triangulations by adding points to the cuts?

11. Attempt optimalStep with *different* steps at different mesh points.


************************* OPTIMIZATION ***************************


Optimization of heat flow:
- use profiler
- try acceleration Ã  la circle packings (see tests.cpp)



********************* TOGGLE BETWEEN METHODS **********************

In order to go from "DiscreteFlowIteratorEnergy method" to "DiscreteHeatFlow method" you must:

1. In discreteheatflowfactory.h: Comment line 68, uncomment line 67
2. In discreteheatflowfactory.cpp: Comment line 206, uncomment line 205
3. In h2meshcontructor.cpp: Comment line 31, uncomment line 30
